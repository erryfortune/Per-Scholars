  <p>I'm a Software Engineering Student at Per Scholas.
i have always had an interest in computer programming since
i was child but never had the opportunity as my parents wanted me to follow in line
with a career in Petroleum Engineering which i obtained in 2011.
i spent several years working in the oil and gas fields in west texas as a drilling fluids engineer.
in the year 2021 i met a friend who introduced me to per scholas
and now here i am looking forward to make the very best out of this massive opportunity.
below is a link of an image that represents me and also a list of things i find interesting.</p>
